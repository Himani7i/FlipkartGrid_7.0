Question:
Given a set of N points(the corners of the square) in the Cartesian plane, WAP for the side of the smallest square that can be obtained with the coordinates(N points) from the given set. The sides of the square need to be parallel to the x,y axes. 

Constraints:
4<=N<=100
Input Format:
The first line of input contains an integer, N, the number of points.
Next N lines, each of which conatains input of X and Y coordinates (separated by a single space )
Output Format:
A single line of output contains the side of the smallest square.
